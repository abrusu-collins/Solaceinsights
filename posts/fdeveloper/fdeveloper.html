        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>Welcome miss Yaa Sam. We are glad to have you on SolaceInsights. Miss Yaa,please tell us about yourself?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Thank you so much for having me. It is a great pleasureüòä. I am a young lady who is currently in her second year at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and is offering a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer science. I am the youngest girl in my family and I love reading novels in my spare time. I commit myself greatly to everything I am involved in and always strive for the best.

        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span> Wonderful. So we would like to know, amongst all the IT professions,why did you go in for Cyber security and Cryptography?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Actually I was not interested in Cybersecurity at first. In fact I was not interested in Computer science at all. I wanted to pursue Nursing but ended up with Computer scienceüòÖ. All the same I decided to go ahead with it and to my surprise I ended up loving it. As for Cybersecurity I was trying it out to see what it actually was about and have found it to be an awesome field to get into.

<div class="second">
    <div class="sol">
        
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span> Wow,so what motivated you to pursue Computer science even though you were not interested in it at first?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> My dad always said he wanted us to have much better lives than he had,so anytime I am pursuing something, I do it with all that I have because I know that if I put my all in anything I am involved in, it is going to have a great impact on my future and make my parents proud.

<div class="second">
    <div class="sol">
       
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span> Very inspiringüòä. Moving into a deeper aspect,what would you say Cyber security and Cryptography is all about? If you could give a brief explanation to it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Cybersecurity is mostly about protecting and defending systems connected by internet that includes hardware, software and data from all kinds of cyber attacks. Cryptography is also a set of techniques that protect the integrity of networks, programs and data from any kind of damage or unauthorized access.
        </p>

<div class="second">
    <div class="sol">
       
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  Great,what then would you say distinguishes an ethical hacker from a normal hacker?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Ethical hackers mostly work for the government or other organizations to protect data or deal with crime whilst normal hackers mostly have programming knowledge but do not use such knowledge for any benefit but rather use it for malicious purposes.

<div class="second">
    <div class="sol">
        
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  Malicious purposesü§î.With that being said what are your thoughts on cyber crime and how is Cybersecurity handling it?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Cyber crime comes in many forms ranging from identity fraud,cyberextortion to email fraud and the surprising thing is that such crimes are not even committed by only hackers now. These crimes make use of the computer as an instrument to further illegal ends. Cybersecurity educates us on how to protect ourselves on the internet and I think it is helping most people who are always on the internet and enabling them to hide sensitive information about themselves online.

    <div class="sol">
        
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  What skills does a person need to have before entering into this field and what should he or she expect?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> First and foremost soft skills like communication and articulation should be at his or her finger tips as you would have to be communicating effectively with management and customers.Also you need to have a bit of experience in programming with good knowledge in Java,C or C++,Python among others.Having a good understanding in architecture,administration and management of operating systems will also come in handy. Generally one should have an open mind to problem solving.

        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>   Thank you for the head start there Miss Yaa Samüëå,very insightful. How did the whole learning process start for you?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
       
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> I was trying out some fields of study like Artificial Intelligence, Database Administration,including Cybersecurity. I kept going back and forth and I could not make up my mind but there was something about Cybersecurity that kept calling me. I just have this urge to help people and solve their problems and that kept me going.So let us just say I am an internet therapistüòÑ. I got myself familiar with some programming languages like Java and C++ then later moved on to learn SQL and Python to get a head start.

    <div class="sol">
       
        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  Thank you very much our Internet therapistüòÖ.We would like to know the challenges you have faced so far as a female in a male dominating field and how you overcame them?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> The one challenge I have faced so far is not being able to connect and interact with a female Cybersecurity community that would help motivate, inspire and offer support when certain challenges come up in the learning process. I therefore read blogs on Cybersecurity written by women to stay inspired and also patronize platforms like stack overflow to clarify certain programming issues I encounter
           My family has been really supportive of my career choice and always offer any help they can. Whenever I feel like giving up, I talk to God to draw more strength to keep my head in the game.        </p>

        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>   Aww that is inspiring Miss Yaaü§ßü•∞.Which parts of Cybersecurity and Cryptography have you come to love and why?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
       
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> I would say <span>security analysis or vulnerability analysis </span>is one  aspect that I have come to love. It is the process of defining, identifying, classifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in computer systems, applications and network infrastructures. The reason why I love it is because I get to see whether application or systems built is strong enough to survive a <span> cyber breach</span> and if it is not strong enough, what I can do to rectify its vulnerabilities.

        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  Wow so coolüôå.What advice would you give to anyone and especially females planning on starting  a career in it?
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span>  I would tell anyone especially females who are interested in Cybersecurity to go in for it and put their all into it as well. There are few women in this sector, but that should not serve as a stumbling block to doing what you love. Just keep learning and working hard. As the saying goes ‚Äúwhat men can do, women can do better‚Äù,therefore believe that you can do it. There are lots of opportunities out there for women in Cybersecurity, use it to your advantage and make yourself proud. Later you are going to look back and high five yourself in your mindüòÑ and laugh and say ‚Äúyes I made it‚Äùüí™.

        <p><span>SolaceInsights: </span>  Wonderful,are there resources you think will be helpful to any person in this field or wanting to get into it?
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>Yaa Sam:</span> Yes there are .I would recommend online sites like cybrary and edureka. They offer great online courses on Cybersecurity. There are also great books on Cybersecurity that you can read. You can check out Hacking: The Art of Exploitation,Practical Malware and Analysis among others. If you are wanting to get into such a field, it is better if you have some knowledge about computer science and programming, then you move on from there.
