      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">Hey there lovely viewers of SolaceInsights, it has been long and you have been dearly missed but don’t worry, SolaceInsights is back more interesting than ever. With the current pandemic that has taken over the world, many innovations have been brought up to combat it but how has technology contributed to this fight? We as IT lovers would want to know how technology has responded to this COVID-19 crisis,that is why SolaceInsights has brought you this interesting piece. Hope you enjoy</p>
<p class="p1">
IT ninjas and tech gurus all over the world are going all-out to contribute their quota to the fight against COVID-19. Many technology workers and companies are joining efforts to alleviate the COVID-19 crisis in numerous ways, including developing products to combat the virus, tracking and predicting its spread, and protecting hospitals from cyber attacks. Technology is definitely doing a lot. Let us look at the ways it is helping to fight this pandemic.</p>

        <div class="last">
        	<h2>Breathing equipment</h2>
        	<img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/cpap.jpg">
        	<p>
        		Apparatuses for breathing are very vital to the treatment of patients with severe respiratory issues that have come up due to COVID-19. Early reports suggest that 50% of patients given oxygen through <span> Continuous Positive Airway Pressure </span>(CPAP) devices have avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.Unfortunately, many countries around the world have been faced with critical shortage of this apparatus causing a high demand for it in this season.However,countries such as the United Kingdom have come up with latest solutions with an unlikely source. It is said that Mercedes Formula One, a company involved in producing pistons and turbochargers worked with University College of London engineers and clinicians to build a <span>CPAP </span>breathing apparatus that pushes oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator. The apparatus uses 70% less of oxygen than earlier models helping to conserve the oxygen for a larger number of people and it is very efficient at helping the patients recover faster. This is a great step technology has taken and would greatly help to save lives.

        <div class="ninth">
        	<h2>Contract tracing</h2>
        	<img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/contact-tracing-1.jpg">
        	<p>
        		Tracking the spread of the virus has so far proven to be an effective way of containing the spread of the virus. Mobile contact tracing initiatives have been launched in various countries such as China and Ghana that are greatly helping in the checking of the spread. Rival companies like google and apple have announced a joint project that will use a phone short distance Bluetooth-based networking signals to track the spread of the disease.

            <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/covid-tracker.jpg">
            <p>Liechtenstein,a German-speaking microstate  has begun a pilot programme to fit its citizens with biometric bracelets to track potential cases of COVID-19 in real time to create  an early warning system . The bracelets for the project are being supplied by Ava, a Swiss medical technology company which currently sells the bracelets to help women monitor their fertility cycles. The bracelets will collect data on metrics such as skin temperature ,breathing rate and heart rate – data that will then be sent to a laboratory in Switzerland for analysis. It is hoped that this data will help health professionals develop algorithms that can detect the exact pattern of subtle changes in individuals’ physiology that can then identify likely cases of COVID-19 even before symptoms are noticeable.</p>

            <p>Over in china, numerous innovations have sparked up that are helping in the combat of COVID-19. Let us find out what these technologies are and how they are contributing to help fight this pandemic.</p>

        <div class="eighth">
        	<h2>Big data and facial recognition.</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		Chinese AI companies like SenseTime and Hangwang Technology have claimed to come up with a special facial recognition technology that can accurately recognize people even if they are masked. Access to public information has led to the creation of dashboards by several organizations that are continuously monitoring the virus. These dashboards are developed using Big data. Smartphone apps are also being use to keep a tab on peoples movements and ascertain whether or not they have been in contact with an infected person.

        	<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

With the help of data analytics and predictive models,medical professionals are able to understand more about a lot of diseases. Baidu, the chinese internet giant has made tools to effectively screen large populations and an AI-powered infrared system that can detect change in a persons temperature. It was being used in Beijing’s Quinghe Railway Station to identify passengers who were potentially infected . The system can examine up to 200 people in one minute without disrupting passenger flow.Also Alibaba has developed a cloud based coronavirus diagnosis tool that the company claims is more that 96% accurate and takes less than 20 seconds to work. The tool uses AI to detect traces of the virus. Alibaba says that it has been used on more than 5000 patients throughout China.

        	<h2>Health sensors and apps.</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

Chinese government joined hands with tech giants ,Alibaba and Tencent to develop a color-coded health rating system that is tracking millions of people daily. The smartphone app was first deployed in Hangzhou in collaboration with from Alibaba. It assigns three colors to people ,green,yellow and red on the basis of their travel and medical histories . Whether a person should be quarantined or not or allowed in public spaces was decided based on the color code . Citizens had to log on to the app using pay wallet services like Alibaba Alipay, ants wallets etc. Only people who were assigned a green color code could be allowed in public spheres after using the designated QR code at metro stations, offices and other public places.

Wow, technology is indeed contributing a lot and has come a long way to save the lives of many.
