        	<h2>Are there women in tech?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        	The world of IT has and is still being considered as a place solely for men. While that thought can be backed by the fact that more men are involved than women, there are great women who are involved in IT that are bringing new ideas,innovations and solutions to the table. It is quite sad we are lacking the greater number of women to be involved but that does not undermine the fact that women can be great game changers in the world of tech

        	<h2>Are there Female coders?</h2>
            
        	
        	<p>
        		I bet you there are. Female coders have evolved over the years and are making tremendous impact in the world of IT. Though they are not many and the number of men in IT greatly outweigh that of women,great female coders have evolved over the years that are making huge impact.Here are just a few.

        	<h2>Some experiences shared by some female coders</h2>
        	<h2>They all started from somewhere</h2>
        	<p>
        		The powerful women in tech we see today did not just start on a silver platter. A lot had challenging beginnings but were able to pull through despite the odds. Tracy Chou is one astounding woman who pulled her way through this world of tech. Tracy Chou studied computer science at Stanford University and specialized in machine learning and artificial intelligence.While studying at Stanford, she interned at Google,Facebook, and Rocket Fuel and went on to receive a master’s degree in Computer Science. <span>Describing her undergraduate experience studying computer science,Tracy Chou recalled feeling “really out of place.” She stated that she felt less confident than her male colleagues at the beginning and took time to realize that she was outperforming most of them in coursework.</span>  It is not easy getting into a male dominating field as a female. There would be setbacks but then there is the need for great will power to sail through

Entering into the world of coding is not rosy at all. As a beginner being introduced into coding might be difficult in the sense that you are new to computer language syntax,computer codes,and the whole process of racking the brains up to bring awesome algorithms to solve problems. Being a girl in this field might be pretty daunting since things aren’t always delivered on a silver platter. There will be days where your program would just not budge and the brains would be out of  brain-stormy ideas but all this requires consistency and determination. These are key points to surviving the tech world.

        	<h2>Stereotyping is real</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		
Females are often underestimated when talking about the issues of tech. They are seen as unable to match up to the standards males have already set and this dampens the spirit of the female coder. They are often seen as feeble and frail and unable to withstand the pressure in the field. Also the female coder’s knowledge in coding is seen as myopic and would not be able to bring great innovative ideas. With all these view points we see great women like Tracy Chou rising above all odds and moving to great heights in the coding career, where certain men haven’t risen to. This shows that females have a great chance in the world of tech and should be given opportunities to bring out their awesome talent in this field.
