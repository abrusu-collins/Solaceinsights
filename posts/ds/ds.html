    <h1>Interview session:Which data structures do most Data scientist use and why?</h1>

<div class="intro">
    
    <p>Hey there tech lovers,welcome to SolaceInsights. Todayâ€™s post promises to be interesting as it is a Question and Answer Series. In this series we give our lovely followers a chance to ask any question that baffles their minds in relation to technology. Our beloved guest and follower for todayâ€™s session is a lovely lady who is a tech enthusiast and has great passion and drive for motivating ladies to involve themselves in the area of technology. She holds the position of Womenâ€™s Commissioner for the Computer Science Society in Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and technology and is also a full stack web developer. Amazing right , I introduce to you Mary Gyakariâœ¨ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ.</p>

        <p class="h1">Let us get started.</p>
        <p><span>Mary Gyakari: </span> I have gained great interest in data science after the recent post on SolaceInsights and would want to know more. I have been hearing a lot about data structures and algorithms in the areas of data science and machine learning and that brought up the topic: Which data structures do most Data Scientist use and why? I am excited and cannot wait to know more.</p>

           <span>SolaceInsights:</span> Data Structures are special formats for organizing and storing data. They are efficient for collecting data in a way that specific operations can be performed on them in an effective manner.As the name goes, Data-Structures presents data in a specific type of structure or format that suits the purpose for its storage. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on it. Data Structures are very broad but in relation to data science here are just a few examples: 
        </p>

    </div>


    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/data-structure.jpg">

    <p> <span>Matrix â€“</span> It is a special case of a two dimensional array where each data element is of strictly the same size. Python doesnâ€™t have a built-in type for matrices. However, we can treat list of a list as a matrix.</p>

    <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon.png">

    <p> <span>Series â€“ </span>A Series is a one dimensional data structure that can take any data type such as integer,float,string etc. Very useful when you want to perform calculations that return 1-D array</p>

    <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (1).png">


    <p> <span>Data frame â€“</span> A Data frame is a two-dimensional data structure that presents data in a mutable tabular format in rows and columns.</p>

    <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (2).png">



    <p><span>Lists â€“</span> A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item . The items of a list are enclosed in square brackets [ ] separated by commas.Lists are flexible in that they can contain different datatypes.</p>

     <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (3).png">

    <p> <span>Dictionaries â€“ </span>a dictionary is a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output. Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys.</p>

     <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (4).png">


    <p><span>Tuples â€“ </span>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas.They are used to store related items like latitude and longitude coordinates. It is a data structure in python used to store immutable ordered sequence of elements.</p>

     <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (5).png">

    <p>Tuple unpacking is where the values assigned to the tuple are assigned to individual variables which are distinct</p>

    <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (6).png">

    <p><span>Sets â€“ </span>A set is an ordered collection with no duplicate elements. Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Operations like union,intersection,difference and symmetric difference can be performed on sets .Curly braces{ } or the set( ) function can be used to create sets</p>

     <p>Example in python:</p>
    <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/carbon (7).png">

        <p><span>Mary Gyakari: </span> Which data structures do data scientists prefer and why?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="gl">
        
        <p>
           <span>SolaceInsights:</span>  Every data structure is essential in its own way but when it comes to specific tasks that need to be accomplished on certain kinds of data,specific types of data structures that suit the purpose are considered. We will be examining some data structures and find out how they are essential for data scientists and the tasks that best suits them,particularly for the python programming language. 
        </p>
       <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/python-pic.jpg">

       <p> <span>Lists </span>  are the most versatile data structures in python and are able to store data items of different data types ranging from integers to strings etc. They are mutable therefore allowing for their elements to be changed any time. List are also ordered in sequential order making it very essential when dealing with data items that require order. Lists can further be passed into numpy arrays to make it easier to perform essential and numerous calculations on it due to its versatility. Lists definitely come in handy in numerous ways and are used widely by most data scientists.</p>


       <img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/dictionary.png">

       <p class="sol"> <span>Dictionaries </span> are a set of key:value pairs as mentioned earlier that are unordered. Dictionaries are considered to be fast and efficient in the areas of searching and processing information. Unlike lists and tuples where searching is done sequentially, dictionaries use hashing techniques for dictionary look ups which are designed in a way to search for the exact place where the data item is stored.This especially helps searching to be done fast when dealing with big data sets unlike lists. Also when considering making meaningful deductions from relationships between data items,dictionaries are a good place to look at since they store items as key value pairs.Now these are the features dictionaries offer that make most data scientist consider it than other data structures.</p>

       <p> <span>Dataframes </span> are also essential data structures used by a lot of data scientist for a number of reasons. First of all,dataframes present data in an excel like structure or tabular format that makes analysis way more easier because of the ability to easily see through your data as it is presented in the form of row and columns. Not only that, dataframes being a feature of the pandas library enables you to get access to a wide variety of functions and methods that enable you to make great manipulations on your data to bring out awesome insights. We could talk of being able to perform subsetting operations and summary statistics to gain meaningful deductions. Dataframes greatly come in handy for a lot of data scientists.</p>

       <p class="sol"> <span>Sets </span>are also useful data structures that have properties that can help data scientists in their work. Sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element. This makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.</p>

       <p>Lastly, <span>Tuples </span> are very essential when less memory usage is required. Tuples are also immutable therefore iterating through a tuple is faster than with a list.</p>

       <p class="sol">From all these points we can say that different data structures serve different purposes when needed therefore making them all relevant to data scientist in their work.</p>
