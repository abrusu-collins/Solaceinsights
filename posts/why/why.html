		<h1 id="post_head">Why Data Science?</h1>
	
      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">Hello guys, solaceinsights comes your way again with another interesting blog post on why Data Science?</p>

         <p class="p1">Do well to enjoy</p>

         <p class="p1">There have been many digital transformations going on with businesses and industries all over the world. Many companies and businesses are moving from the traditional methods to using digital technologies to make their strategies and decisions much better. Fortunately, data science is a focal point to all these transformations. Why? With Data science organizations no longer have to resort to using hypothesis, smart guesses or even few surveys to make important decisions. Instead they will be analyzing large amounts of real data to base their decisions on data driven facts

<p class="p1">However Data science is not limited to the area of business data but to so many areas. It is ubiquitous and has become a center connecting all other areas such as statistics,data analysis,deep learning,machine learning and their related methods to itself.</p>
        <div class="last">
        	<h2>What is Data in Data Science actually?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		The data in data science is not anything one cannot wrap their head around. It is actually the raw values, numbers,figures,names,items,audios,videos,amounts of products,customer tastes or preferences,population values or even dates gathered from certain events. It is not bounded to any specific thing but actually it is everything one can think of. Everything around us is data ,be it in a business confinement, home, school,hospital or anywhere else one can think of. This brings us to the fact that everything around us is important no matter how small it is and data science seeks to bring this to light.

        <div class="ninth">
        	<h2>What then does data science do and why is it important?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		In simple terms I would say, data science does the work of gathering scattered data and bringing it to meaningful use. It creates the avenue to break down data to derive great insights from it. These ideas and deep meaning gotten from data then help to make excellent decision,deductions and great conclusions that can be helpful not only to the business sector but to other areas such health,sports,education and many others.

        	<p>
        		Data science has contributed a lot to making our society a smart one. How? Data Science is being utilized by health-care start ups to use artificial intelligence to examine images like x-rays and MRI s to diagnose problems quickly. Also, it has played a great role with the creation of new delivery apps with better mechanisms to make our lives easier. Not forgetting the area of education in which it has contributed immensely by the creation of awesome e-learning platforms to make learning easier,faster,convenient and at ones own pace. Data Science is involved in many areas than we think. It is broad and promises to bring more in the coming future. I just cannot wait to see what it has in store.
