		<h1 id="post_head">My experience as a beginner in Data Science</h1>
	
      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">Data Science is a very interesting career to dive into but doesn’t come that easy though. I was introduced into Data Science by a great initiative of DIV(Developers In Vogue) in collaboration with DataCamp and my experience afterwards has been tremendous. Surprisingly, I had no idea or prior experience about Data science or even thought of getting into that career path. It was after being a beneficiary of this initiative that stirred up the desire to know more about Data Science. I started researching and reading about what Data science actually was and why it is important to get into that area. I found awesome information that sparked me up to get greatly involved in data science.</p>

        <div class="last">
        	<h2>Programming experience so far with python</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		Python is very versatile and has various libraries available for learning Data science. Its syntax is cool and simple to grasp with no difficulties and its pretty comprehensive. I would recommend python for any beginner in data science. During the first course at DataCamp which was introduction to python, I was introduced to some basic syntax in python which were mostly about printing simple python calculations, variable declarations,comments and conversion of datatypes. I later went on to learn about lists and how slicing and dicing of lists goes on. I also learnt about all the various operations that can be performed on lists and how they are very flexible and not bound to any data type.Learning Lists was really eye-opening. The first course wouldn’t have been complete without Numpy arrays. Numpy array is an awesome package for containing huge sums of data and comes in handy when organizing data with its 2D ability. Numpy arrays are really cool and I cant wait to get my hands dirty with some data using numpy arrays.

  <p class="p1">
    
    The second course introduced me to basics with matplotlib and gave me the chance to explore with pyplot which is an awesome sub package of matplotlib and also gave me the chance to learn about data visualization which talks about how data could be brought to a more visual understanding through graphs. This enables exploration and report insights.Matplotlib comes in handy here and enables the creation of awesome graphs.

   <p class="p1">
     Below is a sample code and its output. Pretty interesting right

   </p>

   <pre >
     # Scatter plot
plt.scatter(x = gdp_cap, y = life_exp, s = np.array(pop) * 2, c = col, alpha = 0.8)
   </pre>

   <pre>
     # Previous customizations
plt.xscale(‘log’)
plt.xlabel(‘GDP per Capita [in USD]’)
plt.ylabel(‘Life Expectancy [in years]’)
plt.title(‘World Development in 2007’)
plt.xticks([1000,10000,100000], [‘1k’,’10k’,’100k’])
   </pre>

   <pre># Additional customizations
plt.text(1550, 71, ‘India’)
plt.text(5700, 80, ‘China’)</pre>

<pre>
  # Add grid() call
plt.grid(True)
      </pre>

<pre>
  # Show the plot
plt.show()
   </pre>

  <pre>Output
     </pre>

         <p class="p1">This and more can be done with python. Now that’s cool</p>

        	<h2>I am loving it</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		I would not say I have not faced any challenges, on the contrary I have but with the drive and love I have gotten for it , the journey seems promising.Though it is not easy I have developed a great love for it and I can’t wait to explore more and learn more. Data Science is cool and I would gladly recommend it for anyone ready to mess with data. Data is awesome
