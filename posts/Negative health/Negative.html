      	<p class="p1">Hello there tech lovers!!!</p>
<p class="p1">
solaceinsights has got you at heart and wants your best health even in your use of technology. That is why we have brought you this awesome and informative piece. Sit back ,relax and enjoy</p>
<p class="p1">
The world is taking up a whole new transformation in this Covid-19 crisis. With there being the need for people to stay at home in order to prevent the spread, human interactions have moved from the normal face to face communications to online based interactions using some platforms like Zoom,Skype,Microsoft Teams and the like. Most businesses have resorted to the wave of letting their employees work from home likewise schools and colleges are now into the use of e-learning platforms more than ever. With how our world is moving, we can agree that ,there would not be a day where our technological gadgets will not be of use.</p>

        <div class="last">
        	<h2>Are there negative effects to the move?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        	Yes there are. Frequent contact with these gadgets would render us getting too exposed to the illumination they emit. Aside the illumination would be the musculoskeletal problems associated with bad posture, wrong sitting positions among many others. Illumination does not only affects our eyes but other parts of the body also. These further result in massive health problems which can affect us greatly if not taken into consideration.

        <div class="ninth">
        	<h2>Health problems that could arise from this.</h2>
            <h2>1. Computer vision syndrome or Digital eye strain</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		The human eye is unique and delicate in its own way . It is unable to adapt to staring at a spot for several hours and also the dosages of illumination that these devices emit. Computer vision syndrome comes about due the eyes’ inability to withstand these illuminations and the retaliation of the eye against it brings about symptoms such as eye strain,irritation,redness and blurred vision accompanied with headaches.These symptoms can be pretty disturbing at times and often persistent. These have the chances of becoming great due to improper lighting of a room and screen glaring.

        <div class="eighth">
        	<h2>Is there a way out of this?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		These side effects are inevitable but can be managed. Wondering how? Let us find out.According to American Optometric Association (AOA),the 20-20-20 rule to ease eye strain is a very good step to take. To follow this rule, try to take a 20-second break every 20 minutes to look at something that’s 20 feet away.Also make sure your glasses or contact lens prescription is up to date and adequate for computer use.Occupational glasses may be needed for some people with the syndrome. A single or bifocal lens, or tinted lens material, may help increase contrast perception and filter out glare and reflective light to reduce symptoms of eye strain.

        <div class="seventh">
        	<h2>2. Insomnia</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

Being up all day staring at and sitting in front of an illuminated screen could make you feel gruesomely restless at night.An uncontrollable state of consciousness could rob you of your sleep and make you extremely tired in the morning. Wondering how this is possible?The answer is simple, Melatonin. Study shows that exposure to the blue light that devices emit can suppress melatonin,the hormone that is involved in regulating cycles of sleeping and waking up. Less melatonin can make it harder to fall asleep and results in you being less alert in the morning due to interruption in your circadian clock.

        <div class="sixth">
        	<h2>How do we deal with this issue?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

This can be reduced by taking breaks in between time spent with the device to enjoy some indoor game or cool music. This helps relaxes the brain and reduces the strain.Try taking some few minute strolls around your house and also try some indoor exercises as exercises are very important.

        <div class="fifth">
        	<h2>3.Repetitive strain injuries</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

Repetitive strain Injuries are gradual buildups of damaged muscles, tendons, and nerves from repetitive motions.With the constant clicking,pressing,typing,watching,sitting,leaning,lying among all other postures one could think of ,we are likely to encounter pains in most parts of our bodies such as the neck,elbows,forearms,shoulders and wrists. This may be due to the constant strain of our nerves and tendons. Some symptoms may include throbbing,numbness,weakness and pain ranging from mild to severe.

             <p>This seems quite alarming but surely there is a way out</p>

        <div class="fourth">
        	<h2>How to manage it</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		
This may be reduced with taking short exercises between hours of using these gadgets.Also ensure good sitting postures and positioning. Check out wikihow for good sitting posture and webMD for some exclusive indoor exercises. To know more about managing it ,do well to check out healthline for more details.
