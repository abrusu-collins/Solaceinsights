      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">Yes,we went on a break but we are back and in full gear.This time,we are talking about autonomous vehicles, thatâ€™s right, autonomous vehicles.</p>
         <p class="p1">
             Are you a fan of self-driving cars? Have you ever dreamt of being in one? I bet you have. Self-driving cars are not new at all,in fact they even existed in the 1920â€™s and numerous experiments have been conducted on them since then. The first ever self driving vehicles appeared in 1980â€™s with companies and institutions like Mercedes-Benz,Carnegie Melton Universityâ€™s Navlab, AVL among others contributing immensely in its production. Since then numerous companies and organisations have developed working ones which have been undergoing tests. You can read more about it here. Although it has been in existence for quite some time, they have not been made available for use to  the general public yet. Are we getting close to the era where they will be in full gear? Do self driving cars promise to be the future of transportation? Are you excited as I am? Well let us zoom right in to find out ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨ðŸ’¨ðŸš˜.

        	<h2>What powers autonomous vehicles?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		It seems magical just to think about vehicles moving on the road with no human in the driverâ€™s seat. Unfortunately, it would not be a magical wand that sparked it in motion. Autonomous vehicles are vehicles capable of sensing its environment by the combination of sensors and software that enables the vehicle to have the control it needs to drive. Autonomous vehicles operate in six levels which are standards accepted by the U.S Department of Transportation. These can further be categorized into two groups: human monitoring the driving environment and the automated system monitoring the driving environment. In the first group,humans have a part to play in the driving process whereas in the second group, no human intervention is required for the vehicle to carry out its actions.

<p class="p1">A picture depicting how autonomous vehicles are able to sense their environment.</p>
            <p>Autonomous vehicle systems are able to create internal maps of their driving environments by use of a number of sensors like the radar and high-powered cameras which are then processed by the system to design plots of path the vehicle should take. Other elements such as actuators help in controlling the steering and the braking and also computer algorithms,predictive modelling among others help the vehicle in the detection of objects based on their differences.

Many companies have risen up that are working greatly in the development of these autonomous vehicles. Here is a run down of a few.</p>

Autonomous vehicles are fascinating and overwhelming to see in action but could there be pitfalls associated with them? Will further testing of these cars lead to them being totally safe and approved for consumption by the public?

There are certainly doubts about self driving cars being in full gear in the coming years. This may be due to certain pitfalls like it being vulnerable to hackers who can get access to the software and control the vehicle any how they want. Another could be about computer malfunctions which are likely to occur since these vehicles work with so much technology and a glitch at a certain part may cause harm to the whole system. With how roads and cities differ,will the self driving vehicle be able to deal with the issue of unfamiliar roads? Talk of accidents that are likely to happen if a self driving car fails to make a good detection of a road since it is not familiar with it.

            <img src="1_H-d8R3lPlFEfcZtMAPbuaA.png">
            <p>We could go on and on about a lot of its mishaps but all these instances are being taken into consideration. Manufacturers and programmers are constantly racking their brains to clear out all pitfalls. Technology evolves,technology grows. What may seem like a problem today may be easily solved in the near future. As rigorous tests are being taken on these vehicles, I am hopeful that most of its pitfalls will be solved and we will have our autonomous vehicles on our streets in no time. The kind of technology that powers these autonomous vehicles is just fascinating. I cannot wait for what it promises to bring in the future.
