      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">With the digital transition our world is taking, various technologies have risen up that are contributing in numerous ways to help sustain it. Cloud computing is undoubtedly one of them and today on SolaceInsights,we want to dig in deep to what cloud computing actually is. With there being a high demand for it, it is expedient to know more about,that is why SolaceInsights has brought you this awesome piece. Do well to enjoy.</p>

        	<h2>What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
        	<img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/person-cloud-1.jpg">
        	<p>
        		Well at the mention of <span>Cloud computing </span>, one cannot help but think of people on white clouds with computers busily working out something. Now that is totally not itüòÖ .There is definitely a different meaning to it and we are about to find out. <span>Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing service over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis </span>. Awesome but let us go deeper.üòé

        <div class="ninth">
        	<h2>What is ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù in Cloud Computing?</h2>
        	<img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/structure-of-the-internet.jpg">
        	<p>
        		The term ‚Äúcloud‚Äù as used in Cloud computing is a metaphor to stand in place of the internet,creating the understanding that the cloud is a virtual place for numerous connected servers and data centers that come together to provide a computing resource for computing services. The structure of the internet is seen as a haphazard connections of nodes that somewhat form a kind of spherical shape. With the inability to classify it as a sphere, the shape of the cloud was likened to it giving rise to the name, CLOUD. Whoa I know rightüò≤. We so thought wrongü§≠.

        <div class="eighth">
        	<h2>How is the cloud being used in Cloud Computing then?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		Our world is moving from its traditional method of doing things to digital ways which now mostly involves the internet. This transition then brings the issue of more data usage and the need for more data storage systems at low costs. That is where Cloud Computing comes in. Cloud computing solves this and more. It offers the opportunity for services ranging from web hosting , deploying of applications,online business transactions, storage and retrieval of data and many more to be run on the cloud at minimum costs. Basically, all you can think of can be done on the cloud. Now that is amazing.

        	</p>
        </div>

        <div class="seventh">
        	<h2>Why has Cloud Computing become a way out of this issue of more storage space ?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

IThe cloud is a ginormous connection of data centers and servers in a virtual environment that operate on the principle of shared resources. With the cloud,big data storage and handling becomes easy and convenient. Companies no longer have to stress themselves in procuring servers and various infrastructure to manage huge data. Services are now rendered fast and easy with the use of the cloud. Transactions are now fast with no traffic jams whereas websites hosted on a cloud service are also able to keep the sites running during moments of traffic. Individuals like you and I no longer have to deal with the issues of storage space running out due to the amazing cloud services rendered by Google docs, icloud, OneDrive,Dropbox among many others. Cloud Computing is definitely awesome.

        <div class="sixth">
        	<h2>Why is it safe and cost effective?</h2>
        	
        	<p>
        		

The hardware storage units of companies and businesses may crush and destroy at any time due to the overload of data on these devices. Poor maintenance, infrequent updates among many others could also be contributing factors. These issues and more are solved with Cloud Computing. Companies and businesses no longer have to worry about the maintenance and updating of these infrastructure since the cloud takes care of all of that. If unforeseen circumstances do happen and these infrastructure get destroyed, they do not have to fret at all because they will be able to retrieve the data from the cloud, provided they did store it there.

  <p>
      
      Now to the <span>area of security</span>. Most people have doubts when it comes to the Cloud being secure. Let us see why that should not be the case. Cloud services are offered by big companies like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services,Microsoft Azure, CISCO among others that have great teams on board to ensure that activities on the Cloud are safe,secure and without any security breaches or loss of data. These security response teams are constantly working to ensure all malicious threats are dealt with to bring about the efficiency of the Cloud Service.This team is on point to guard the Cloud under the latest software and technology. Now you might wonder,how do these teams ensure cloud security? They do so in three steps, that is <span>gaining visibility, monitoring data, and managing access </span>. These methods use advanced machine learning techniques and models that assess the deviations in each case. They go by the principle of patterning and therefore are able to detect when someone is using unauthorized or illegal means in a Cloud service .With visibility, they are able to get access to all activities going on in the Cloud and are able to identify persons who have breached certain security principles. These Security Response teams use Privileged Identity management (PIM), a technique used to manage access to the service the Cloud offers and are able to deny any suspicious and unauthorized access to the cloud. With these technologies in place, there is no way any malicious activity can go unnoticed. The Cloud is definitely a safe place.

        <div class="fifth">
        	<h2>Cost effectiveness of the Cloud.</h2>
        	<img src="../../cat folder/tech knowledge/cloud-cost-effective-2.jpg">
        	<p>
        		

The Cloud operates on a principle of shared resources on a pay-as-you-go-basis. This means the amount of services rendered on the cloud is scaled to fit any situation you are in. For instance if your website is getting a lot of traffic ,it is expedient to gain lots of servers to sustain it. With Cloud Computing services, you can acquire the amount of servers you need for that moment with the required payment and when the traffic goes down you can reduce the amount of servers and pay a minimum cost for the few in use. This is really cost effective and beneficial unlike the traditional ways where you had to acquire more physical servers to handle the traffic and had to still pay for servicing even after the traffic goes down.Cloud Computing is much better than the traditional way.

        <div class="fourth">
        	<h2>Why is it in demand?</h2>
        
        	<p>
        		

With all the benefits of using Cloud services, why wouldn‚Äôt Cloud Computing be in demand? Companies and businesses are moving from the old ways of doing things and are employing cloud services because of its efficiency,cost effectiveness, scalability and security. This move has brought with it a high demand for Cloud engineers. This is definitely a heads up for all IT ninjas out there and a great opportunity for all tech lovers to be in demand. Google in partnership with Pluralsight is giving free access to Cloud Computing courses on Pluralsight for free. Please check it out here. The free enrollment lasts till May 31st .Go get it and be in demand.
