      <div class="post_body">
      	<p class="p1">We have gone through half of the year and have seen how tremendous technologies have risen up to contribute greatly in various facets of our lives. As we would gladly rank top movies,songs,artists,actors and actresses, I believe technology should not be left out at all. Technology is making great impact and it is good to rank them in grand style. Let us get right to unraveling what these top 10 hottest and trendiest technologies areüòé.</p>

        <div class="last">
        	<h2>10.Robotic Process Automation</h2>
        	<img src="rpas.jpg">
        	<p>
        		Robotic Process Automation is no new technology. It existed as early as 1990 and has been evolving and booming ever since. Robotic Process Automation is the technology that allows for configuration of computer software, or a ‚Äúrobot‚Äù to emulate and integrate the actions of a human interacting within digital systems in order to execute a business process. These robots use user interfaces to capture and manipulate applications just like we humans do. Not only does this software work faster but also accurately, as it makes almost zero mistakes. Companies like Bluprism,UiPath,AutomationAnywhere and Softomotive have been incorporating RPAs into their businesses as it improves efficiency and enhances productivity. You can read more on RPAs <a href="https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robotic-process-automation"> here</a>.
